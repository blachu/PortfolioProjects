Project scope: COVID-19 data exploration with SQL
Dataset: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths
//

#1 Getting out dataset:
- move column "population" right behind "date"
- select everything from "new_tests" to the right end of dataset and delete - save as CovidDeaths
- restore that data (ctrl+z). Delete everything between columns "population" and "weekly_hosp_admissions_per_million" - save as CovidVaccinations

#2 Import datasets into SQL
- I had an issue with datasets. Whenever column starts as a blank cell and any values appears after more than just few line (20+), then after data import to SQL it showed that these columns contains only NULL values
- So thing I did (after looking on many-many solutions) was just to add 0 (zeroes) to each blank cells that were at the beggining of columns.  I mean, if on row number 1500 was a blank cell then I did not add any 0 there.
